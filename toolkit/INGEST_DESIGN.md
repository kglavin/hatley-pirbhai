# Brownfield Ingest (hp-ingest) — design

## ✅ Status: Locked 2026-05-23

All 5 open questions resolved with recommended defaults:
- **Q1.** First demo target after hatley-pirbhai self-ingest: **cloudctlplane**.
- **Q2.** PSPEC granularity: **per-process-cluster**.
- **Q3.** hp-ingest proposes trust zones: **no, defer entirely** to `hp-propose-architecture`.
- **Q4.** Brownfield-with-existing-dictionary support in v1: **greenfield-only**; `--incremental` covers code-change reconciliation.
- **Q5.** Confidence + provenance on every IR node: **yes, every node**.

**Status:** locked.
**Branch:** `kg/brownfield-ingest`.
**Spawning context:** the original "next thing" deferred from the brownfield review back in Apr–May 2026. We've since shipped the modernization layer + the project portal, so hp-ingest now lands on a much richer toolkit. The design below incorporates patterns lifted from a focused review of [Understand-Anything](https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything) (see *Provenance* below).

## Goal

Take a brownfield codebase → produce a `dictionary.yaml` that the rest of the HP toolkit (validate, render, status, portal, PDF) can consume. The output should be:

1. **Architecturally meaningful** — entities are HP entities (terminators, processes, data stores, state-rich bubbles needing CSPECs, leaf processes needing PSPECs, architecture modules + interconnects), not "every function in the codebase."
2. **Reviewable by an architect** — every inferred entity has a confidence score + a provenance list (`implemented_by: ["src/foo.py", "src/bar.py"]`) so a human can sanity-check the inference and override.
3. **Incremental** — re-ingesting after a code change should produce a sensible diff, not blow away everything. Keyed off `gitCommitHash` in the project meta.
4. **Composable with the existing modernization skills** — hp-ingest produces the core 5 stages; `hp-propose-observability` / `hp-propose-slos` / `hp-capture-adr` / etc. enrich after.

## Why this is the right shape

Three insights from the [Understand-Anything](https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything) review (full notes in conversation log; key data sample at `understand-anything-plugin/packages/dashboard/public/knowledge-graph.json` — UA's self-analysis: 97 nodes, 183 edges, 7 layers, 12 tour steps):

1. **80/20 scripted/LLM.** UA's own graph uses 4 deterministic edge types (`contains` / `imports` / `exports` / `calls`) for 173 of 183 edges. Only 9 edges (5%) come from LLM judgment (`related` / `similar_to` / `validates`). The bulk of the graph is mechanically extracted — LLMs add a thin semantic layer. **Implication for HP:** tree-sitter / import-resolver does the heavy lifting; LLMs classify what's a Stage-1 terminator vs Stage-2 process vs Stage-5 module. That's the value-add.

2. **Aggressive significance filter.** UA's monorepo has many hundreds of TS symbols; the graph has 97 nodes. **Implication for HP:** the dictionary captures what an architect would draw on a whiteboard, not every function. For cloudctlplane-scale projects, target ~50–100 entities, not thousands.

3. **Every LLM agent gets a deterministic script in front of it.** UA's project-scanner is 95% scripted (git ls-files + extension map + import resolution); LLM only writes the description. File-analyzer: tree-sitter extracts symbols deterministically; LLM only chooses tags + complexity. **Implication for HP:** every agent in our pipeline pairs with a bundled `.py` script that emits a structured input. LLMs never write the validation/parsing scripts.

## Architecture: 6 agents + one IR

> **Note (2026-05-25):** the base architecture below is unchanged. Two follow-up arcs extend it without altering its shape:
> - [INGEST_TUNING_DESIGN.md](INGEST_TUNING_DESIGN.md) (Branches 1+2) — adds deterministic prep stages (docs walker, glossary extractor, user-docs gatherer, testbed miner, recipe parser, rationale gatherer) + the optional `hp-ingest-glossary` LLM curator skill. Same agent set; richer inputs.
> - [HIERARCHICAL_INGEST_DESIGN.md](HIERARCHICAL_INGEST_DESIGN.md) (Branch 3) — makes Stage 2 (`hp-process-extractor` / `hp-ingest-processes`) recursive for monorepos. Same agent; runs N times (once per subsystem deserving deeper decomposition) instead of once.

### The 6 agents

| # | Agent | Job | Input | Output | Script-in-front |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `hp-scanner` | Inventory files, detect languages / frameworks, classify each file with an HP role hint | project root + `.hpignore` | `scan.json`: `{project, languages, frameworks, files[{path, language, sizeLines, hp_role_hint, ...}], importMap}` | `scripts/hp_scan.py` does git-ls-files, language detection, framework heuristics, calls a small per-file classifier (tree-sitter + extension + keyword) for the HP role hint. LLM only writes the project description. |
| 2 | `hp-boundary-finder` | Identify the system boundary: terminators + boundary flows | `scan.json` | `boundary.json`: `{terminators[], boundary_flows[]}` | `scripts/hp_boundary_candidates.py` extracts CLI entry points, HTTP listeners, external client SDK calls, cron entries, message bus subscribers from `scan.json`. LLM classifies which are real Stage-1 terminators vs internal abstractions, names them, writes descriptions. |
| 3 | `hp-process-extractor` | Decompose `sys_root` into level-1 processes + data stores + internal flows | `scan.json` + `boundary.json` | `processes.json`: `{processes[], stores[], internal_flows[]}` | `scripts/hp_process_candidates.py` clusters files by directory + import-cluster + role-hint, surfaces candidate process groupings. LLM names the processes, decides which are state-rich (`needs_cspec: true`), draws internal flows between them. |
| 4 | `hp-leaf-analyzer` | Per leaf process: produce CSPEC (state machine) OR PSPEC (functional contract) | one process at a time, with its file cluster | enriched node in `hp-graph.json` | `scripts/hp_extract_state_machine.py` looks for state-enum + transition-table patterns; if found → CSPEC candidate. Otherwise → PSPEC. LLM writes the actual content (states, transitions, transformation body). **This is the only parallelizable agent** (3–5 concurrent, batched by process). |
| 5 | `hp-architect` | Stage 5: identify hardware / software / organizational modules + interconnects; allocate processes | full `hp-graph.json` | `architecture.json`: `{modules[], flows[], interconnects[], allocations[]}` | `scripts/hp_architecture_candidates.py` surfaces deployment-unit candidates from Dockerfile / docker-compose / k8s manifests / package manifests. LLM names modules, draws interconnects, allocates processes. |
| 6 | `hp-assembler-reviewer` | Merge intermediates → repair → emit final `dictionary.yaml` | all intermediates | `dictionary.yaml` + `ingest-report.md` | `scripts/hp_merge_graph.py` does deterministic merge (strip prefixes, normalize enum aliases, drop dangling edges, validate against HP schema) and writes a stderr report of unrecoverable issues. LLM repairs the flagged issues and emits the final YAML. |

### The IR: `intermediate/hp-graph.json`

A single growing JSON file, accreted across phases. Each agent reads + writes. The reviewer's merge script is the only thing that mutates by deletion.

```

**Note the differences from UA's IR:**

- **HP entity kinds, not implementation primitives.** `terminator` / `process` / `data_store` / `state` / `pspec` / `architecture_module` / `architecture_flow` / `architecture_interconnect` — the same vocabulary `dictionary.yaml` uses.
- **`implemented_by[]` provenance array.** A process can be implemented by many files; many files might compose one process. UA's path-keyed IDs (`file:src/foo.ts`) don't work here.
- **`confidence` per node.** Architect-reviewable. The reviewer can sort by lowest confidence to know what to spot-check.
- **`stage` per node.** Records which agent produced it. Drives the renderer + the "which stage produced this?" view.

## HP role hints (per file, per Stage 0)

`hp-scanner` tags every file with one of six role hints. **This single signal is the highest-leverage classifier in the pipeline.** Downstream agents use it heavily.

| Hint | Match heuristic | What it implies |
|---|---|---|
| `boundary` | HTTP handlers, gRPC servers, CLI entry points, message-bus subscribers, file-watchers, cron jobs | Likely participates in Stage-1 boundary flows; likely Stage-5 allocated to an outward-facing module |
| `pure-logic` | Files with no I/O imports, only domain types + functions | Likely Stage-4 PSPEC content. Most-likely-PSPEC role. |
| `state-machine` | Files containing state-enum + transition-table, or saga-style coordinator patterns | **`needs_cspec: true` candidate.** Stage-3 driver. |
| `data-store` | DB client init, cache client init, queue client init, ORM model declarations | Likely Stage-2 data store, sometimes Stage-5 module (DB itself). |
| `infra` | Dockerfile, docker-compose.yaml, k8s manifests, terraform, ansible | Stage-5 architecture module signal. Tells the architect what's deployable. |
| `config` | TOML/YAML/JSON config, env-var schemas | Cross-cutting; rarely a node, sometimes informs trust zones (modernization). |

The classifier is a small Python script in `scripts/hp_classify_role.py` — no LLM. Uses extension + path + a few content regexes. Cheap, deterministic, runnable on millions of files.

## Significance filter

What gets into the dictionary vs what stays out:

- **In:** files / clusters classified `boundary`, `state-machine`, `data-store`, `infra` (always). `pure-logic` clusters that exceed a threshold of lines-of-code or that have ≥1 inbound flow (= someone calls them).
- **Out:** tests (`*_test.*`, `tests/`, `spec/`). Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, `target/`). Generated code (heuristic: file says `// AUTO-GENERATED` or `# DO NOT EDIT`). Documentation (`*.md`, `docs/`). Trivial config that doesn't influence architecture.

The filter is in `scripts/hp_significance.py`. Configurable thresholds (e.g., min-LOC for `pure-logic` cluster). Defaults tuned to produce ~50–100 entities on a cloudctlplane-scale project.

## Tuning guide

Defaults are tuned for repos in the ~50–200 file range (where the toolkit cut its teeth). Larger projects need two knobs turned, or the LLM stages get drowned in candidates and the resulting dictionary has thousands of bubbles where the architect wanted dozens.

### `--min-pure-logic LINES` — the significance threshold

`pure-logic` files are the bulk category — internal modules that aren't framework boundaries, state machines, data-store wrappers, or infra. Most internal code falls here. The significance filter promotes a `pure-logic` file to Stage-2-candidate only if it exceeds `min_pure_logic_lines` *or* has ≥1 inbound reference. Default = 50.

That default is tuned to a small project. On a monorepo, 50 lines is "trivial helper" territory and you get tens of thousands of candidates that the Stage-2 LLM has no chance of clustering meaningfully. Raise the threshold:

| Project size | Files (significant) | Recommended `--min-pure-logic` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small (single service, <200 files) | <100 | 30–50 (default) |
| Medium (~200–1000 files) | 100–300 | 75–125 |
| Large monorepo (>1000 files) | 300+ | 150–250 |

The signal we're chasing: "a file that's substantive enough that an architect on a whiteboard would draw a bubble for it." Below 50 lines, almost nothing is. Below 150 lines in a monorepo, almost nothing is either — modules are smaller because the project is wider.

Sweep: re-run with `--scan-only` at a candidate threshold, eyeball the `is_significant=true` count, adjust. Threshold tuning is cheap (deterministic Python scan), and gets the LLM-cost side of the run into the right ballpark before you commit to a full ingest.

### `--max-depth N` — directory cluster depth

The Stage-2 process-candidate extractor groups files by directory. By default it walks the full tree, which means in a monorepo you end up with `src/services/foo/internal/handlers/v2/legacy/` as a distinct cluster of one file. That fragments process candidates badly — the Stage-2 LLM sees 400 clusters of 1–3 files each instead of 30 clusters of 10–40 files each.

Cap with `--max-depth`:

| Project shape | Recommended `--max-depth` |
| --- | --- |
| Single-service flat tree | unset (walk fully) |
| Service-oriented (`src/<service>/...`) | 3 |
| Deep monorepo (`apps/<area>/<service>/<layer>/...`) | 4 |

The rule of thumb: depth = "how many path segments before you reach the level the architect would label as a process." `src/orders/validation/rules.rs` → orders is the process, depth=2 (counting `src` as 1).

### `--resume` — power-outage and iteration recovery

The pipeline writes one JSON file per stage (`scan.json`, `boundary.json`, `processes.json`, `leaf-<proc>.json`, `architecture.json`, `hp-graph.json`). With `--resume`, each stage checks for its output file + validates it against the Pydantic schema; if present and parseable, the stage is skipped with a `[resume]` notice. If it fails to load, the stage re-runs.

Use cases:
- **Power outage / killed terminal** mid-Stage-5 (the failure mode that produced this section). Re-run with `--resume`; the orchestrator picks up where the last completed stage's JSON landed.
- **Iterating on a single stage's prompt.** Delete the JSON for the stage you're tuning (and everything downstream), re-run with `--resume`. Earlier stages are pinned.
- **Debugging the merger or emitter without re-spending LLM tokens.** All upstream JSON is preserved; only the deterministic post-pass re-runs.

The progress log at `<output-dir>/progress.log` is the source of truth for which stages completed. `START` / `DONE` / `SKIP` rows tell you the run history; `--resume` reads the per-stage JSON, not the log, so a manually edited JSON file is honored.

### Putting it together on a large monorepo

The cloudctlplane shape (a polyglot Python+TS service mesh, ~4000 files) is the canonical "large" target. Recommended first-run flags:

```bash
uv run python scripts/hp_ingest.py ~/path/to/repo \
    --output ~/hp-ingest-runs/my-project \
    --min-pure-logic 200 \
    --max-depth 3 \
    --no-architecture     # optional: skip Stage 5 the first time, run separately after review
```

Then sanity-check the scan stats before the LLM stages dispatch — `[resume]` lets you halt after Stage 0, eyeball the candidate counts, retune, and re-run.

## Implementation order

Three commits on this branch, mirror of the portal arc:

### Commit 1 — Scanner + IR + role classifier
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/schema.py` — Pydantic IR schemas.
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/role_classifier.py` — the 6-category HP role hint.
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/scan.py` — Stage 0 scanner (no LLM, pure Python).
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/significance.py` — filter.
- `skills/hp-ingest-scan.md` — agent definition for the scanner pass.
- `scripts/hp_ingest.py` — CLI stub that runs scan-only.
- **Verified by:** running `--scan-only` against `examples/fishing-rig` and against `hatley-pirbhai` (self-test). Output: `intermediate/scan.json` with role hints on every file.

### Commit 2 — Boundary + process + leaf agents
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/boundary_candidates.py`, `process_candidates.py`, `state_machine_detector.py`.
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/merge_graph.py` — IR merge + normalization.
- `skills/hp-ingest-boundary.md`, `hp-ingest-processes.md`, `hp-ingest-leaf.md`.
- CLI advances to Stage 4 lock.
- **Verified by:** ingesting the **hatley-pirbhai toolkit itself** (~30 files, mostly Python) and producing a draft `dictionary.yaml` — IR + dictionary should be reviewable against the hand-written toolkit structure.

### Commit 3 — Architect + assembler-reviewer + dictionary emit
- `hp_toolkit/ingest/architecture_candidates.py`, `emit_dictionary.py`.
- `skills/hp-ingest-architect.md`, `hp-ingest-review.md`.
- `skills/hp-ingest.md` — the master orchestrator skill.
- CLI completes the full pipeline.
- **Verified by:** end-to-end ingest of a larger second target (TBD per Q1 below) → review the emitted dictionary against the architect's mental model.

## Token economics — Python does 70–80% of the work

The architectural decision that keeps cost sane is **the per-file role classifier in pure Python**, not an LLM. That single move drops ingest token cost roughly 10× vs the naive "ask the LLM about each file" approach. UA uses the same trick (`extract-structure.mjs` does tree-sitter parsing; LLM only summarizes).

Per-agent budget:

| Agent | Script does (free) | LLM does (paid) | Tokens / call |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hp-scanner` | git-ls-files, language detect, framework detect, **per-file role hint** (highest-volume operation) | One-paragraph project description | <1k |
| `hp-boundary-finder` | Extract CLI entries / HTTP listeners / external SDK calls from scan.json | Classify each candidate as real terminator vs internal abstraction | 5–20k |
| `hp-process-extractor` | Cluster files by directory + imports + role-hint | Name processes, set `needs_cspec`, draw internal flows | 5–15k |
| `hp-leaf-analyzer` | Gather source code for one process | **Reads actual source code.** Writes PSPEC body OR CSPEC state-machine | **20–50k × N leaf processes** (parallelizable 3–5 concurrent) |
| `hp-architect` | Extract deployment-unit candidates from infra files | Name modules, draw interconnects, allocate processes | 5–15k |
| `hp-assembler-reviewer` | Deterministic merge + schema validate | Repair only what the merge script flagged | ~5k |

**Total per full ingest:**

- Fishing-rig scale (~30 files, 4 leaf processes): **~50–100k tokens**, sub-dollar at Claude API rates.
- cloudctlplane scale (~1600 files, ~30–50 leaf processes after the significance filter): **~300–800k tokens**, $1–5 per full ingest.

`hp-leaf-analyzer` dominates because it's the only agent reading raw source code. Everything else operates on aggregated structured summaries. **The significance filter is therefore the highest-leverage cost lever** — tightening it from "every pure-logic cluster over 50 LOC" to "over 200 LOC" can cut total tokens 2–3×.

Incremental ingests are much cheaper — see below.

## Incremental updates

The full picture, not just the trigger. `--incremental` mode operates on the diff between the last ingest's commit and HEAD, re-runs only the agents whose inputs touched, and reconciles against the existing dictionary with strict preservation rules.

### Trigger + propagation

1. Read `project.gitCommitHash` + `project.analyzedAt` from existing `dictionary.yaml`.
2. `git diff <last-hash> HEAD --name-only` → list of changed files.
3. **Per-agent re-run gates:**
   - `hp-scanner`: re-classifies only the changed files.
   - `hp-boundary-finder`: re-runs only if changed files include `boundary` role hints OR if any frameworks were added/removed in scan.json.
   - `hp-process-extractor`: re-runs only if any cluster's membership shifted (file moved between role hints, or file added/removed).
   - `hp-leaf-analyzer`: re-runs **per-process**, only for processes whose `implemented_by[]` files actually changed. Most processes unaffected — most ingests touch maybe 1–3 processes.
   - `hp-architect`: re-runs only if infra files (Dockerfile / compose / k8s / terraform) changed or if a new boundary module appeared.
   - `hp-assembler-reviewer`: always runs (merge + emit).

Typical commit (3–10 files changed in 1–2 processes) costs **5–30k tokens**, an order of magnitude under a full ingest.

### Reconciliation rules — what hp-ingest writes vs what it preserves

**hp-ingest writes (and can replace on incremental):**

- `entities:` — terminators, processes, data stores, states (the Stage 1–4 structural entities)
- `flows:`, `edges:`, `transitions:` (Stages 1–3)
- `pspecs:` `transformation` body (Stage 4 main content)
- `architecture_modules:`, `architecture_flows:`, `architecture_interconnects:` (Stage 5 structural)
- `architecture_module_specs:` / `architecture_interconnect_specs:` core `description` + `design_rationale` (Stage 5 prose)

**hp-ingest preserves verbatim (never touches on incremental):**

- `adrs:` — Architecture Decision Records (modernization #10)
- `budgets:`, `tpms:` (modernization #21/#22)
- `service_level_objectives:` (modernization #32)
- `bounded_contexts:` (modernization #5)
- PSPEC `verification:` blocks (modernization #25)
- PSPEC + ArchModule `observability:` blocks (modernization #1)
- ArchInterconnect `stride_mitigations:` + `linddun_mitigations:` (modernization #8.2)
- `references_mitre_attack:` / `references_cwe:` / `references_compliance:` lists on AMS / AIS / ADR (modernization #8.3)
- Any field hp-ingest didn't author originally — including hand-written `description` overrides, custom `notes`, etc.

The mechanism: every IR node carries a `provenance.agent` field. On incremental reconcile, the merger checks per-field — if `provenance.agent` is one of `hp-ingest-*`, it's eligible for replacement; otherwise it's preserved.

### Conflict surface

When new ingest contradicts existing dictionary (process renamed, kind changed, terminator removed), the reviewer emits `ingest-conflicts.md` listing each diff for manual review **before** writing the new dictionary. Nothing changes until the user approves. User can reject individual diffs and the merger preserves the existing value.

If the user runs `--incremental --auto-accept`, conflicts are resolved by taking the new inference. Default is conservative (`--auto-accept` is opt-in).

### Orphans

When a file is deleted, it's removed from every `implemented_by[]` list. If a process's `implemented_by` becomes empty, the process is **marked as orphan** (not deleted). The reviewer logs it in `ingest-report.md`; user decides whether to delete or keep as a forward-looking placeholder. Same for terminators / data stores / modules that lose all evidence.

## Modernization fields

**Not produced by hp-ingest in v1.** Rationale: modernization fields (trust zones, observability surface, ADRs, SLOs, V&V, STRIDE) are *architectural decisions*, not extractable facts. The existing `hp-propose-*` skills do them well with form-based review.

Workflow:

1. `hp-ingest <codebase>` → produces dictionary.yaml with Stages 1–5 + role hints + provenance.
2. `hp-validate` → confirm structural soundness.
3. `hp-propose-observability` / `hp-propose-slos` / `hp-capture-adr` / etc. → user runs each modernization skill against the ingested baseline, locks one form-based proposal at a time.

The exception: **`trust_zone` per architecture module** *might* be inferrable from infrastructure files (Dockerfile labels, k8s namespaces, network policies). See Q3 below.

## Provenance

This design is informed by:

- **[Understand-Anything](https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything)** — multi-agent codebase analyzer. Reviewed in detail (conversation log). Borrowed: agent-with-script-in-front pattern, intermediate JSON IR, type-alias tables for LLM enum drift, incremental updates via gitCommitHash, aggressive significance filter, tour/traceability narrative. Skipped: file-keyed IDs (HP entities are conceptual), 21-type vocabulary (HP needs 8), domain-analyzer (HP Stage 2 IS the domain), pedagogical tour (HP needs traceability tour).
- **Earlier brownfield review** (firewalled inspection of cloudctlplane + bru) — pattern-level observations that informed [project_brownfield_ingest_patterns memory](../../memory/project_brownfield_ingest_patterns.md). The 6-category role hint taxonomy comes from this review.
- **The full HP toolkit context** — every choice here aims to produce a `dictionary.yaml` consumable by the existing validate / render / status / portal / PDF / modernization pipeline. No new vocabulary; just an automated way to populate the existing one.

## Open questions

Mark up below — I'll lock the doc + start Commit 1 once these are resolved. Same form-based-proposal pattern used for MODERNIZATION_DESIGN.md, BOUNDED_CONTEXTS_DESIGN.md, PORTAL_DESIGN.md.

### Q1. First demo target after hatley-pirbhai self-ingest?

- [x] **cloudctlplane** — real polyglot brownfield mess Kevin knows inside-out. Highest signal; output is IP-laden so reviews stay pattern-level (same firewall as the earlier brownfield study).
- [ ] **bru** — kernel sensor + userspace; smaller than cloudctlplane but kernel-version-targeted is unusual. Also IP-firewalled.
- [ ] **A small open-source project** (e.g., a moderately-sized Python or Rust project on GitHub) — open everything; no firewall, lower stakes for first dogfood.
- [ ] **Solar / fishing-rig (synthetic)** — we already have hand-written dictionaries. hp-ingest output diffable against ground truth.

I lean **cloudctlplane** for the real-world signal once Commit 1 + 2 are stable on hatley-pirbhai self-ingest. Solar / fishing-rig are useful as **regression tests** (does hp-ingest's output match the hand-authored dictionary?). Open-source as a **public demo** target later.

### Q2. PSPEC granularity — per-function or per-process-cluster?

A "process" in HP is a single bubble that may be implemented by multiple files / functions. PSPEC is the functional contract of a leaf process.

- [x] **Per-process-cluster** (recommended): the leaf-analyzer agent takes the cluster of files for one process, produces a single PSPEC describing the process's overall input→output transformation. Matches HP's intent (one PSPEC per leaf bubble).
- [ ] **Per-function then merge** — write a PSPEC per function, then merge at review time. More granular, more work, mostly redundant since the dictionary only needs one PSPEC per process.

I lean **per-process-cluster**. This is the right HP semantics. The per-function structure is preserved in `implemented_by[]` provenance.

### Q3. Should hp-ingest *propose* trust zones?

`trust_zone` is the one modernization field with strong infrastructure signal — Dockerfile `USER`, k8s namespace + network policies, VPC declarations, etc.

- [x] **No, defer entirely** — hp-ingest stops at Stages 1–5 core; `hp-propose-architecture` (which already covers trust zones in its Decision 9) handles it via form-based review. Cleanest separation.
- [ ] **Yes, infer + mark as proposed** — hp-ingest's architect agent extracts trust_zone from infra files into the IR with `confidence` < 1.0. Reviewer surfaces these for user confirmation. Faster path to a complete modernization-layer-ready dictionary.

I lean **defer entirely (the first option)** for v1. The hp-propose-architecture / hp-propose-threat-model flow is already form-based and works well; hp-ingest's job is to produce the substrate they review. Mixing in trust-zone inference blurs the responsibility boundary.

### Q4. Brownfield-with-existing-dictionary support in v1?

- [x] **Greenfield-only for v1** (recommended): hp-ingest assumes no existing `dictionary.yaml`. Output is full overwrite. User runs once; thereafter they hand-edit + use `--incremental` for code-change reconciliation.
- [ ] **Merge mode from day one** — hp-ingest takes a pre-existing `dictionary.yaml` and merges. More work, more edge cases. Useful when user has hand-authored part of the dictionary already.

I lean **greenfield-only for v1**. Merge mode is a v2 feature; the `--incremental` path covers the common case (code changes after initial ingest). If the user wants to merge a hand-authored dictionary with an ingested one, that's a feature for a future commit.

### Q5. Confidence + provenance shape — required on every node?

- [x] **Yes, every node** (recommended): both `confidence: 0..1` and `provenance: { agent, rationale }` required on every IR node. Renderer surfaces lowest-confidence entities to the architect for spot-check.
- [ ] **Confidence yes, provenance light** — confidence required; provenance only on judgment-call entities (skip on terminators inferred from clear infra signals).
- [ ] **Neither — keep IR clean** — drop both, trust the LLM, fix during reviewer pass if anything goes wrong.

I lean **every node**. Confidence is cheap to ask the LLM for (one extra field per node); provenance is the only thing that lets the architect quickly debug "why did hp-ingest infer X?". This is also what makes the renderer output reviewable in the portal — show confidence as a pill color.
